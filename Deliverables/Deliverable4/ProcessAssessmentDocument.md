## 2 Process used
The process used to develop the <i>AverageSentenceLength</i> project is a process described by the Waterfall Life Cycle Model with a slight modification. The modification being that revisions to previously completed documents or phases of the project are allowed so long as the revisions are properly documented and exceptional.

## 3 Activity assessment:

###Deliverable 1:
#####Process Plan Document
* Quality of the deliverable: <b>100</b>; the Process Plan Document details the project, its phases and estimated schedule quite effectively.

#####Requirements Document
* Quality of the deliverable: <b>98</b>; the Requirements Document appears very thorough, although every requirement might not be known given the project's time frame.

###Deliverable 2:
#####Design Document
* Quality of deliverable: <b>95</b>; the Design Document addresses the software product's structure, assumptions and target platforms.

#####Test Plan
* Quality of deliverable: <b>90</b>; well documented but the Test Plan document does not list all test cases later conducted with unit testing.

###Deliverable 3:
#####Code
* Quality of deliverable: <b>100</b>; the code is well structured, easy to follow and includes extensive unit testing.

#####User Documentation
* Quality of deliverable: <b>90</b>; simple and effective, however, the User Documentation could have included examples such as successful and unsuccessful program executions with error message examples for unsuccessful executions.

###Deliverable 4:
#####Process Assessment Document
* Quality of the deliverable: <b>90</b>; A concerted effort was made to provide an objective process assessment for the project.

## 4 Productivity assessment
* Total time spent: <b>31 Hours</b>
* Total lines of code in delivered product: <b>402 lines</b>
* Total lines of user documentation: <b>17 lines</b>
* Productivity score: <b>93</b>; the time spent on the project is a bit high. As is apparent on other parts of the project, document format and systems learning might have taken up time depending on the team members' individual experience.

## 5 Quality assessment
* Total number of test cases: <b>28</b>
* Total number of defects found during testing: <b>1</b>
* Total number of defects fixed: <b>1</b>
* Quality score: <b>98</b>, the quality of the software product was tested extensively beyond the test cases described within the Test Plan document using the unit testing framework JUnit and was successful in finding and correcting found defects.

## 6 Recommendations:
* More collaboration during all phases of the project.
* Improve frequency of communication.
* Utilize GitHub repositories more effectively and to their full potential by adding artifacts earlier.
* Adhere better to established and agreed upon schedule.

## 7 Summary:
Overall, team 11 performed well on all deliverables and submitted a quality software product after extensive unit testing for quality assurance.  All documents were effective and informative with respect to their intended purpose.  It is not apparent by looking at team 11's GitHub repository that all team members worked on, or contributed to, all phases of the project equally.  However, all team members did contribute in roughly equal amounts and the final delivered product is overall quite effective. It is apparent that certain phases of the project required updating after moving on to other phases of the project which presents difficulty when using a Waterfall life cycle model but appears to have been handled well and such updates were minor and properly documented.
